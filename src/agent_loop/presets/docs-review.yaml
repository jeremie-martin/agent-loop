description: Documentation review with self-orchestrated verification

prompt_prefix: |
  FIRST: Find and read all markdown documentation in this project before doing anything else.
  Search for and read: README files (root and subdirectories), CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, and all
  files in docs/ or documentation/ directories. Understand the codebase's patterns, conventions,
  and architecture. Only then proceed with your task.

  IMPORTANT - When spawning sub-agents:
  Sub-agents do not automatically have the context you have. For each sub-agent you spawn:
  1. Give it the exact file paths to relevant documentation (CLAUDE.md, README, etc.)
  2. Explicitly instruct it to read those files completely before starting its task
  3. Include any other specific files it needs to examine

  Do not assume sub-agents will find documentation on their own — give them the paths.

prompt_suffix: |
  Do not use the "question" tool or any tool requiring user input.
  Stage and commit your changes at the end with a descriptive message.

      Good documentation is accurate, navigable, and clear. It respects readers'
      time, uses consistent terminology, and doesn't repeat itself unnecessarily.

      Documentation that serves readers well:
      - Matches what the code actually does
      - Has clear structure that's easy to navigate
      - Uses precise, concise prose
      - Avoids redundancy that adds no value

      Before editing any documentation, read the corresponding source code to verify
      current behavior.

      Focus on improvements that readers will notice. A few meaningful fixes—
      correcting inaccuracies, clarifying confusing sections—are better than
      many minor tweaks.

      Leave alone what already works. "No changes needed" is a valid outcome.

      **After completing your changes**, orchestrate verification:

      Spawn a sub-agent to review your work. Give it:
      - The paths to relevant documentation files and instruct it to read them first
      - The files you modified
      - Instruction to check: do changes match the goals? Anything missed?
        Opportunities to simplify?

      Address the feedback, then commit.

  - name: coherence
    prompt: |
      Coherent documentation reads as a unified whole. Topics appear once, in the
      right place. Readers can navigate without encountering redundancy or gaps.

      Signs of coherence problems:
      - Significant overlap between files (consolidate)
      - Same thing said different ways in different places (pick one)
      - Content that doesn't belong in its current location (move or remove)
      - Confusing structure that makes navigation difficult (reorganize)

      Deletion is value. Removing redundant content is as important as improving
      what remains. A smaller, well-organized documentation set serves readers
      better than a comprehensive but scattered one.

      **After completing your changes**, orchestrate verification:

      Spawn a sub-agent to review your work. Give it:
      - The paths to relevant documentation files and instruct it to read them first
      - The files you modified
      - Instruction to check: did consolidation lose important content?
        Is navigation clearer? Any further consolidation possible?

      Address the feedback, then commit.
