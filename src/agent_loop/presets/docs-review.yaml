      Before reviewing the documentation, explore the codebase to build a clear picture of what the project actually does—its architecture, key concepts, public interfaces, and intended workflows.

      Then assess the documentation against that reality. Good documentation earns trust by being accurate: what it describes exists, what exists is described where readers would look for it, and the two don't drift apart.

      For each documentation file, consider: Does this reflect the current state of the project? Are there claims that have gone stale, or capabilities that exist but aren't surfaced? Does terminology match what the code actually calls things?

      Apply corrections directly. Accuracy sometimes means adding what's missing; other times it means removing what's no longer true. Let the implementation be the authority.

      Consider the documentation as a whole—not the accuracy of individual files, but how they work together as a system readers navigate.

      Good documentation suites have shape: a reader knows where to start, how to go deeper, and where to look things up. Each document has a clear job. There's one natural place for any given concept, not three partial explanations scattered across files.

      Read through the documentation and ask: Is there a clear entry point? Do documents link to each other in ways that guide readers, or do they exist in isolation? Are there files that overlap significantly, or gaps where readers would reasonably expect something? Does the organization reflect how people actually approach the project?

      If restructuring, consolidating, or reshaping would improve navigability, apply those changes. But preserve what already works—don't reorganize documentation that readers can already find their way through.

      Review each documentation file for how well it communicates—not whether it's accurate (assume it is), but whether a reader can absorb what it's trying to convey.

      Clear documentation respects the reader's time: sentences do work, paragraphs have focus, sections don't meander. It uses consistent terminology and speaks in one voice. It anticipates what readers need to know at each point without over-explaining what's already clear from context.

      For each file, consider: Does this read well? Are there passages that could be tightened without losing meaning? Is the level of detail appropriate for who's reading this and why? Does the structure help or hinder understanding?

      Make edits that improve clarity or tighten prose. Leave alone anything that already communicates effectively—editing for the sake of editing adds churn without value.
