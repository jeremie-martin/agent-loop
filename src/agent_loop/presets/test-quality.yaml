description: Test suite improvement with self-orchestrated verification

prompt_prefix: |
  FIRST: Find and read all markdown documentation in this project before doing anything else.
  Search for and read: README files (root and subdirectories), CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, and all
  files in docs/ or documentation/ directories. Understand the codebase's patterns, conventions,
  and architecture. Only then proceed with your task. Sub-agents you spawn must do the same.

prompt_suffix: |
  Do not use the "question" tool or any tool requiring user input.
  Stage and commit your changes at the end with a descriptive message.

  CRITICAL: If a test that was passing before your changes now fails, you
  introduced a regression. Fix your changes—do not change the test's assertions.

modes:
  - name: quality
    prompt: |
      Review the test suite for quality. Good tests read as specifications—they
      communicate what the code should do, not just that it runs.

      Examine the tests:
      - Do test names describe the behavior being verified?
      - Are tests isolated? (no hidden dependencies between tests)
      - Do assertions check meaningful things? (not just "no exception thrown")
      - Is setup/teardown clear and minimal?

      Refactor tests that are unclear, coupled, or asserting the wrong things.
      Delete tests that are redundant or test nothing meaningful.

      Leave alone tests that already communicate well.

      **After completing your changes**, orchestrate verification:

      1. Spawn a sub-agent to review your work. Give it:
         - This task (test quality improvement)
         - The test files you modified
         - Instruction to check: do the refactored tests still verify the same
           behavior? Are any regressions introduced? Any further simplification?

      2. Spawn a filter sub-agent. Give it the verification feedback and ask:
         which concerns are genuine vs over-cautious?

      3. Address filtered feedback, then commit.

  - name: consolidation
    prompt: |
      Ensure the test suite doesn't explode in size or redundancy.

      Test suites grow. Each feature adds tests. Without counter-pressure, you
      end up with many tests that overlap, verify the same behavior differently,
      or exist for historical reasons no longer relevant.

      Review the test suite holistically:
      - Are there tests that check the same behavior? Consolidate.
      - Are there tests for code that no longer exists? Remove.
      - Are there overly granular tests that could be combined? Merge.

      Fewer, better tests. Deleting a redundant test is as valuable as adding
      a missing one.

      **After your changes**, run the same verification pattern, then commit.
