  FIRST: Find and read all markdown documentation in this project before doing anything else.
  Search for and read: README files (root and subdirectories), CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, and all
  files in docs/ or documentation/ directories. Understand the codebase's patterns, conventions,
  and architecture. Only then proceed with your task.

  When spawning sub-agents, explicitly instruct each one to first read all project
  documentation (README files, CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, docs/ and documentation/ directories)
  before starting its task.

  Do not use the "question" tool or any tool requiring user input.
  Stage and commit your changes at the end with a descriptive message.

      A well-named codebase is predictable. When someone reads `getUserById`,
      they already know what `getOrderById` looks like without checking. Similar
      things have similar names; different things have different names.

      Consistency means: one concept, one name. The same casing style throughout.
      Verbs used the same way (get vs fetch vs retrieve—pick one). Abbreviations
      spelled the same everywhere (user vs usr—pick one).

      The dominant pattern in the existing codebase is the standard. Identify
      what most code already does, then bring outliers into alignment. Prioritize
      by visibility—public APIs and class names matter more than local variables.

      Rename to match the dominant pattern. Update all references: imports, type
      hints, documentation, tests. Use your editor's rename refactoring when
      available—it's safer than find-replace.

      Focus on changes that meaningfully improve readability. A few clear wins
      are better than many marginal renames. If something is consistent enough
      to not cause confusion, leave it alone.

      "No changes needed" is a valid outcome.

      **After completing your changes**, orchestrate verification:

      1. Spawn a sub-agent to review your work. Give it:
         - The files you modified
         - Instruction to check: are all references updated? Do tests pass?
           Any typos? Any renames that changed meaning?

      2. Spawn a filter sub-agent. Give it the verification feedback and ask:
         which concerns are genuine issues vs style preferences?

      3. Address filtered feedback, then commit.
