modes:
  - name: accuracy
    prompt: |
      Trust is built on accuracy. A single wrong fact makes readers doubt everything else.

      Review written content against reality. For technical writing, verify against the code or system being described. For other content, verify claims are supportable and current.

      Look for: statements that were true once but have drifted, promises that aren't kept, examples that don't actually work, numbers that are stale or wrong.

  - name: structure
    prompt: |
      Structure is a gift to the reader. It tells them where to look, what to expect, and when they're done.

      Review the content's organization. Does it flow logically? Can readers find what they need? Is there a clear beginning, middle, and end? Are related ideas grouped together?

      Look for: buried ledes (key points hidden in the middle), missing context at the start, meandering sections that need splitting, parallel content that should be consolidated.

      Reshape structure where it helps readers navigate. But don't restructure for its own sake—if readers can already find their way, leave it alone.

  - name: cision
    prompt: |
      Concise prose respects the reader's time. Every sentence should earn its place; every word should pull its weight.

      Review for bloat: filler words ("very", "really", "quite"), redundant phrases ("in order to" → "to"), unnecessary hedging, throat-clearing introductions, repetition dressed as emphasis.

      Tighten without losing meaning or voice. A 50-word paragraph that becomes 30 words isn't just shorter—it's clearer, because there's less to parse. But don't compress to the point of obscurity; readability matters more than brevity.
